## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(204, 71%, 46%) - #3498db - A vibrant blue to convey trust and reliability, drawing inspiration from the natural landscapes of Jordan. This color reflects stability and openness, aligning with the values of a dependable ride-sharing service.
- Background color: HSL(204, 17%, 94%) - #f5f5f5 - A very light tint of blue that gives a subtle atmospheric quality to the screen. The scheme matches the brightness of sun-washed desert colors, hinting at a mid-day sky in Jordan.
- Accent color: HSL(174, 48%, 46%) - #45b8ac - Use a turquoise color, reminiscent of the mineral richness and aquifers under the Jordanian landscape, to indicate calls to action.
- Font: Utilize 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif to maintain legibility and modern look that is professional and easy to read across various devices.
- Leverage Font Awesome 6.4.0 for consistent, scalable icons across the application to improve UX. Consider icons with rounded shapes to match button styling.
- Employ a consistent grid-based layout system across all sections to ensure elements are aligned and responsive. The interface uses RTL to accommodate the right-to-left nature of the Arabic language, mirroring all design elements effectively.
- Implement smooth and subtle transitions to enhance user engagement. Use transitions on interactive elements and when switching between sections or themes to create a more engaging experience. Ensure animations don't affect performance and retain a professional look.
